## Practice
- [x] Re-create what you've done the last week but this time using cutter.
- [x] Explore pf command
  - [x] C program that declares a char array of 20 chars
  - [x] Generating a "serial-key" inside that array, that serial key is never printed and "deleted from memory" at some point on the program
  - [x] **GOAL:** keep track of the state of that array every time its values get modified by using pf
### IOLI crackmes
